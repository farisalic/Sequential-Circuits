# Sequential Circuits 
Welcome to my *Sequential Circuits* repository! This repository showcases a collection of VHDL based projects, designs, and modules aimed at digital circuit design and simulation including but not limited to:
* Project examples: Complete VHDL projects demonstrating various digital circuits and systems,
* Test Benches: Test benches for simulation and verification of the VHDL designs,
* Script files that enable faster simulation times, saving the user valuable development time.
